Jo√£o Oliveira (2024)

Replicates Hopenhayn (1992) which finds the stationary equilibrium in a firm dynamics model. I follow the 
algorithm laid out by Gianluca Violante's and Chris Edmond's notes where I solve the incumbant firm problem with value 
function itertation and analytically solve for the stationary distribution. I use Chris Edmond's calibration from his 
example in ch. 3. A slight difference in my code is that I use the rouwenhorst method instead of the tauchen to make 
the continuous tfp process discrete but I still use 20 nodes as in the paper.
